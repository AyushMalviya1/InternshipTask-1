Create a calculator i can use two variable of double type to take number from user and take "continueCalc" of type boolean to ask user to confirm they are want to continue or not if they want to continue, they need to type 1  otherwise type 2.
and i can use String variable to take operator from user, and use switch case to check the what operator user type.
i also check the number if user want to divide number. if the number is 0 then print "cannot divide by 0" or break .
